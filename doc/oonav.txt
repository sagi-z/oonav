*oonav.txt*  Plugin for navigating object oriented code.
  
Description~

This plugin navigates to overridden methods in derived classes either up or
down the inheritance tree, based on tags.

 
Notes

* This is based on tags parsing and needs a tags file for the entire
project to work across files. Managing the tags file is on you (you can try
the 'onetag' vim plugin to automatically manage tags).

* Currently only the default "forward searching patterns" are supported.

* The preview (if enabled) might be wrong if there are several tags with the
same symbol in the same source file.

Contents~

* MAPPINGS (|oonav-mappings|)
* SETTINGS (|oonav-settings|)
* LICENSE (|oonav-license|)


Mappings~
                                                              *oonav-mappings*

These mappings are created by default (see |g:oonav#create_mappings|):
>
    "Goto derived (down the class hierarchy)
    map <unique> <Leader>gd  <Plug>(oonav-down)

    "Goto base (up the class hierarchy)
    map <unique> <Leader>gb  <Plug>(oonav-up)
<

Settings~
                                                              *oonav-settings*


                                                     *g:oonav#create_mappings*

To disable default mappings creation use:
>
    let g:oonav#create_mappings = 0
<
                                                           *g:oonav#allow_fzf*

oonav will automatiaclly try to use fzf if fzf is installed.
If you don't want to allow fzf change the value to 0. The default is 1.
>
    let g:oonav#allow_fzf = 1
<
                                                    *g:oonav#allow_fzf_preview*

oonav will automatiaclly try to use fzf with preview if fzf is installed. If
you want to allow fzf without preview change the value to 0. The default is 1.
>
    let g:oonav#allow_fzf_preview = 1
<
                                                                *g:oonav#perl*

oonav fzf tag preview is using perl. If 'perl' is not in your path the you can
specify the full path here.
The default is to use 'perl' from your PATH.
>
    let g:oonav#perl = 'perl'
