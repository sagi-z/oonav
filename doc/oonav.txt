*oonav.txt*  Plugin for navigating object oriented code.
  
This plugin navigates to overriding methods in derived classes or derived
classes, either up or down the inheritance tree, based on tags.
 
Note this is based on tags parsing and needs a tags file for the entire
project to work across files. Managing the tags file is on you (you can try
the 'onetag' vim plugin to automatically manage tags).
